MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL DATA

This package processes the original CrossWire KJV data as follows:
- Converted from OSIS XML to JSON format
- Restructured into per-verse files organized by book/chapter
- Standardized word structure with position, text, lemma, morph, strongs fields
- Strong's numbers extracted and normalized to array format (e.g., ["G1234"])
- Colophon words (subscriptions at end of epistles) flagged with `isColophon` field
- Verse metadata includes colophon information (hasColophon, colophonWordRange, colophonType)

Gematria values are NOT pre-computed in the stored data; they are computed
on-demand by the scriptures-core library when accessed.
